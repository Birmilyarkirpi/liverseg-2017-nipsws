Some examples obtained with our method can be seen in the following figure. The yellow and green lines delineate the predicted liver and lesion, respectively. The blue and red lines, on the other hand, delineate the ground truth of the liver and lesion, respectively. Finally the light blue bounding boxes are the liver patches detected by the lesion detector.
