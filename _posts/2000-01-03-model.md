The architecture of the model can be seen in the following Figure. It is a cascaded architecture. First, the liver is segmented. Then, the liver region is cropped, and the lesion segmentation network segments the lesion. Finally, a detector samples a number of locations around the liver, and detects whether these liver patches are healthy or not. The final prediction of the lesion are the pixels where both the detection and the lesion segmentation network agree.
